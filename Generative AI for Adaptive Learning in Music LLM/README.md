## GSoC 2025 Report

### Project Title: HarmonyHub: Using Generative AI for Adaptive Learning in Music

**Organization**: INCF

**Contributor**: Priyanshu Tiwari

**Mentors**: Alberto Acquilino, Mirko D'Andrea, Keerthi Reddy Kambham, Thrun, Oscar

**Hugging Face Repo**: [Music LLM](https://huggingface.co/spaces/SHIKARICHACHA/AI_Music_V2)

---

## Project Overview

**HarmonyHub** addresses the need for personalized and adaptive music learning by leveraging Generative AI to dynamically create music exercises tailored to individual learners. It empowers educators through a no-code, interactive platform where exercises are generated based on parameters like difficulty level, instrument, time signature, and rhythm complexity ‚Äî all processed through the **Mistral LLM API**.

This tool is especially useful for students at different learning stages and offers exports in MIDI, MP3, and JSON formats. With a Gradio-based web interface and integrated AI assistant, HarmonyHub is designed to be highly accessible for both teachers and students.

## What I Have Accomplished So Far (By Midterm)

| Milestone | Description                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Week 1‚Äì2  | Completed literature review on music theory and generative music systems. Designed high-level architecture and selected required tools (Mistral API, Gradio, FluidSynth).                   |
| Week 3‚Äì4  | Integrated Mistral API to generate rhythmically and melodically consistent music exercises. Built strict duration scaling system (matching exact number of measures).                       |
| Week 5‚Äì6  | Created multi-format output support (MIDI, MP3, JSON). Enabled MP3 synthesis using SoundFont and FluidSynth. Added automatic package installation and SoundFont fetching.                   |
| Week 7    | Developed and launched a Gradio-based web interface. Enabled user inputs for instrument, time signature, key, difficulty, and rhythmic pattern. Integrated AI assistant for theory queries. |

* Ensuring MIDI conversion preserved timing and instrument assignment correctly
* API key security (temporarily hardcoded ‚Äî need secure handling soon)
* SoundFont compatibility and dependency management across OS environments (macOS/Linux)
